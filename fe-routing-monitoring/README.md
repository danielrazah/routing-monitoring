# fe-routing-monitoring

Real-time dashboard for the FlowPay **routing-monitoring** service. It shows how customer
interactions are distributed across teams and lets an operator drive the flow.

## Stack

- **React 18 + Vite** (build/dev server)
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling (dark, navy/indigo + teal palette)
- **Zustand** for state management (with `persist` for the auth token)
- **@stomp/stompjs** for live updates over native WebSocket
- **Vitest + Testing Library** for tests and coverage

## Architecture (feature-based)

```
src/
├── App.jsx                      # auth gate: login screen or dashboard
├── features/
│   ├── auth/
│   │   ├── authStore.js         # Zustand store (token/roles) + localStorage persist
│   │   └── LoginPage.jsx
│   └── dashboard/
│       ├── dashboardStore.js    # teams / events / status + refresh, serveNext
│       ├── useDashboardLive.js  # WebSocket + polling lifecycle
│       ├── api.js               # dashboard/interaction/team endpoints
│       ├── DashboardPage.jsx
│       └── components/          # Header, TeamCard, EventFeed, NewInteractionForm, CapacityMeter
└── shared/
    ├── api/http.js              # fetch wrapper: adds Bearer, on 401/403 logs out
    ├── api/realtime.js          # STOMP connection
    ├── i18n/i18n.js             # tiny pt/en dictionary picked by browser language
    └── constants/subjects.js
```

Pages/containers read the stores via selectors and pass data to presentational components;
the network lives in `shared/api` and the feature `api.js` files.

## Running

Usually you run the whole stack with Docker from the repo root (`docker compose up --build`)
— this app is then served by nginx on **http://localhost:8090**.

Standalone dev (needs Node 20 and the backend on `localhost:8080`):

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:8090, proxies /api and /ws to the backend
npm run build      # production bundle
```

## Auth & roles

The dashboard requires login. The token (JWT) is stored by `authStore` and sent as
`Authorization: Bearer …` on every API call; a 401/403 clears it and returns to the login
screen. Two demo roles: **ADMIN** (can create/end interactions and advance queues, sees every
team) and **AGENT** (read-only, and scoped to its own team — the backend returns only that team's
data, and the write controls are hidden).

## Internationalization

UI language follows the browser (`navigator.language`): Portuguese for `pt*`, English
otherwise. Strings live in `shared/i18n/i18n.js`.

## Tests & coverage

```bash
npm test            # run the unit/component tests once (Vitest + jsdom)
npm run coverage    # same, plus a coverage report in coverage/index.html
```

Tests live under `src/test/`, mirroring the `src/` tree, and import source via the `@`
alias. They cover the stores, i18n, the HTTP client, the realtime + live hooks, the pages
and the components — line coverage is ~99%. The v8 report is written to `coverage/`.
